This will open the overall scoring screen, as seen below. This screen allows you to see the systems that have the top scores across all areas from beacons to cyber deception.

Please select **r-1x.com**.

Now, using **AC Hunter**, answer the following questions:

1. In the asyncrat dataset, what is the connection interval for 192.168.100.136? What is the dispersion?  What can the dispersion tell us?

2. In the XenoRAT dataset, what is the the connection interval for 172.208.51.75? How is that different from the asyncrat C2?

3. For the dnscat2 dataset, what domain has the highest lookup count? Who is doing the lookups? What does the DNS Lookups look like? Why is there "random" strings in the lookups?

4. In the whattime dataset what is the FQDN for the C2 server?  What does the interval look like? Why would an attacker use a domain like this?

5. In the fiestac2 dataset what is the issues with the MIME data for 68.183.138.51?  Also, what is the issue with the user agent strings? *Hint* hover over the i for more information.
